-Sanguino files based on http://code.google.com/p/sanguino/downloads/detail?name=Sanguino-0023r2.zip&can=2&q=

-avrdude.conf edited to include 1284p

-You cannot use a USBTinyISP with a 1284p as that programmer cannot cope with more thsan 64k flash.
 The Pololu AVR-USB programmer works well, and in theory using another Arduino as ISP should also work.
